## <a name="app-features"></a>App Features

- Users can search the OMDB database to find movies they want to nominate for a Shoppies Award! âœ¨
- Movie posters are animated using [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) and [React Flip Toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit).
- Infinite scroll loads additional movies as the user scrolls and is implemented with [React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer) and [React Content Loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader).
- Movie details and ratings are provided in an accessible modal using [React Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) and can be seen by clicking on a movie poster in the search results or the nominations footer.
- A user's nominations are saved to local storage so results will persist even if they leave the page.
- I chose to build with [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), an experimental state management library for React, because it offers an orthogonal approach to managing state. Selectors are used to handle asynchronous data fetching from OMDB's API.
- The design of the app is responsive and can be viewed on desktop or mobile.
- [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) is used to test the end-to-end functioning of the app.
- Semantic markup and aria labels are used to support accessibility (and tested in Lighthouse and Axe).
- Users select five movies to complete their nominations! ðŸŽ‰

- Refactor CSS to use Tailwind or a similar framework.
- Support users creating sharable links.
- Add more robust testing

## <a name="about-me"></a>About The Developer

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicolle, a graduate from Hackbright Academyâ€™s Full-stack Software Engineering program and currently a Software Engineer Intern at PagerDuty. I'm part of the frontend growth team where I help build and maintain the frontend for customer onboarding, checkout, and free trial signup flows. For our tech stack, we work in React/Redux, Ruby/Rails, and Elixir/Phoenix with modern frontend CI/CD tools (CircleCI, Docker, GitHub, Optimizely, Segment). My team is focused on building a frictionless marketing, product, and customer experience with an emphasis on rapid iteration. I love logging in every day to collaborate with my team, tackle hard problems, learn new skills, and create UI that will be used by millions of people.
