## <a name="app-features"></a>App Features

- Users can search the OMDB database to find movies they want to nominate. üçø
- Movie posters are animated using [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) and [React Flip Toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit).
- Infinite scroll loads additional movies as the user scrolls and is implemented with [React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer) and [React Content Loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader).
- Movie details are provided in an accessible modal using [React Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) and can be seen by clicking on a movie poster in the search results or the nominations footer.
- A user's nominations are saved in local storage so results will persist even if they leave the page.
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) is an experimental state management library for React that offers an orthogonal approach to managing state. Selectors are used to handle asynchronous data fetching from the OMDB API.
- [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) is used to test the end-to-end functioning of the app.
- Semantic markup and aria labels are used to maintain the app's accessibility (and tested in Lighthouse and Axe).
- Select five movies to complete your nominations! üéâ

## <a name="future-improvements"></a>Future Improvements

- Refactor CSS to use Tailwind or a similar framework.
- Add improvements for mobile.
- Support users creating sharable links.

## <a name="about-me"></a>About Me

Hi! üëã I'm Nicolle, a graduate from Hackbright Academy‚Äôs software engineering program and currently a software engineer intern at PagerDuty. As part of the front-end growth team, I help build and maintain the front-end for customer onboarding, checkout, and growth trials. We work in React/Redux and Ruby/Rails (web monolith) with modern front-end CI/CU tools (docker, gulp, GitHub, Optimizely). Our team is focused on building streamlined customer-focused applications and constantly improving the end-user experience. I love logging in every day to collaborate with my team, tackle hard problems, learn new skills, and create UI that will be used by millions of people.
