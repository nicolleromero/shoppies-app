The shoppies app is a SPA built in React that allows users to search for movies (through OMDB's end points) and nominate five movies to receive a Shoppie Award.

## About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicolle, a graduate from Hackbright Academyâ€™s software engineering program and currently a software engineer intern at PagerDuty. As part of the front-end growth team, I help build and maintain the front-end for customer onboarding, checkout, and trials. We work in React and Ruby/Rails (web monolith) with modern front-end CI/CU tools (docker, gulp, github, optimiziely). Our team is focused on building streamlined customer-focused applications and constantly improving the end-user experience. I love logging in every day to collaborate with my team, tackle hard problems, learn new skills, and create UI that will be used by millions of people.
