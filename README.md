## <a name="app-features"></a>App Features

- Users can search the OMDB database to find movies they want to nominate. üçø
- Movie posters are animated using [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) and [React Flip Toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit).
- Infinite scroll loads additional movies as the user scrolls and is implemented with [React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer) and [React Content Loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader).
- Movie details are provided in an accessible modal using [React Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) and can be seen by clicking on a movie poster in the search results or the nominations footer.
- A user's nominations are saved in local storage so results will persist even if they leave the page.
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) is an experimental state management library for React that offers an orthogonal approach to managing state. Selectors are used to handle asynchronous data fetching from the OMDB API.
- [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) is used to test the end-to-end functioning of the app.
- Semantic markup and aria labels are used to maintain the app's accessibility (and tested in Lighthouse and Axe).
- Select five movies to complete your nominations! üéâ

## <a name="future-improvements"></a>Future Improvements

- Refactor CSS to use Tailwind or a similar framework.
- Add improvements for mobile.
- Support users creating sharable links.

## <a name="about-me"></a>About Me

Hi! üëã I'm Nicolle, a graduate from Hackbright Academy‚Äôs software engineering program and currently a software engineer intern at PagerDuty. As part of the front-end growth team, I help build and maintain the front-end for customer onboarding, checkout, and growth trials. We work in React/Redux and Ruby/Rails (web monolith) with modern front-end CI/CU tools (docker, gulp, GitHub, Optimizely). Our team is focused on building streamlined customer-focused applications and constantly improving the end-user experience. I love logging in every day to collaborate with my team, tackle hard problems, learn new skills, and create UI that will be used by millions of people.

## <a name="deployment"></a>Deployment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
